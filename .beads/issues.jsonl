{"id":"cgrs-frontend-3n5","title":"Discussion navigation redesign","description":"Discussion navigation design is clunky and non-intuitive The three column button design design uses a pattern that we want to replace. We would rather use the navigational style found on the management request page, where we have left-hand side tabs like maintenance and repairs, waste management, parking, general inquiry. Can you use the same style of tab navigation which changes the main view for discussion. Maintain the same forum categories and maintain the same thread. Preview slash list on the discussion page. However, split the view between the tabs on the left with the categories and the threads stacked to the right of them.","notes":"Discussion navigation redesign complete. Successfully replaced 3-column button grid with left sidebar navigation matching management-request style. Features: dark forest green theme, client-state category filtering, responsive design with sidebar (desktop) and dropdown (mobile), instant category switching without page reloads. All categories functional and filtering working correctly.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dameon.andersen@clearpoint.co.nz","created_at":"2026-01-23T23:31:52.708516+13:00","created_by":"Dameon","updated_at":"2026-01-26T09:52:13.237319+13:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T09:52:13.237326+13:00"}

CSS at line 979-990 in globals.css shows @media (max-width: 768px) reduces sidebar to single column layout but doesn't hide it. The sidebar takes up valuable screen space on mobile devices. The map-section-wrapper uses CSS grid with 280px sidebar that collapses to 1fr on mobile, but sidebar remains visible.
