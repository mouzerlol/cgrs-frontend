{"id":"cgrs-mobile-map-004","title":"MapSection: Map height minimum could be larger on mobile","description":"MapSection.tsx sets a minimum map height of 400px (line 94), while the component itself uses 70vh in inline styles (InteractiveMap.tsx line 173 shows minHeight: '500px'). On modern mobile devices with taller screens, 400px may feel cramped. The audit spec requires 70vh minimum. Current implementation in MapSection uses dynamic calculation but has 400px floor. Recommendation: Increase mobile minimum to 70vh or ~500px to provide better map exploration experience.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-26T14:33:00+13:00","created_by":"Agent4-Map","updated_at":"2026-01-26T14:23:50.417826+13:00"}
