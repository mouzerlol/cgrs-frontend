Implement a tree-like comment structure with visual connectors and optimize redundant user information display.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nThe discussion thread pages (src/app/discussion/thread/[id]/page.tsx) display comments with several UX issues:\n\n1. REDUNDANT USER INFO (ReplyCard.tsx:86-96)\n   - User's displayName shown in comment header (line 88)\n   - User's title shown in comment header (line 91)\n   - Both pieces of info repeat for every single comment/reply\n   - Takes up significant vertical space with repeated information\n   - No visual parent-to-child reply indication\n\n2. FLAT VISUAL STRUCTURE (ReplyList.tsx:18-96)\n   - Nested replies only use margin-left (ml-11 in Tailwind)\n   - No visual connector lines between parent and child comments\n   - No thread lines showing relationship hierarchy\n   - Only 2 levels of nesting supported (parent + direct replies)\n   - Difficult to follow multi-level conversations\n\n3. SPACE INEFFICIENCY\n   - Each reply header: user name + title + timestamp = multiple lines\n   - No compact author display option\n   - Vertical spacing between replies feels generous (space-y-6, space-y-4)\n\nREDDIT'S PROVEN APPROACH:\nReddit uses a sophisticated comment thread design:\n\n- HIERARCHICAL INDENTATION: Left-side visual borders at 4-12px width serve as navigation\n- CLICKABLE TREE LINES: Each level of nesting has its own left border\n- COMPACT AUTHOR INFO: Username + badge/title shown once, not repeated\n- TREE STRUCTURE: Visual path showing how conversation branches\n- DEPTH INDICATION: Users can count vertical lines to understand nesting level\n- COLLAPSIBLE THREADS: Comments can be collapsed to hide nested replies\n\nSOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:\n\n1. IMPLEMENT REDDIT-STYLE TREE VISUALIZATION\n   [ ] Left-side colored borders for each nesting level\n   [ ] Vertical lines connecting parent comments to child replies\n   [ ] Horizontal connector at start of reply showing it's a child\n   [ ] Visual color coding for different nesting depths\n   [ ] Smooth transition lines (no jagged connections)\n   [ ] Responsive spacing that works on mobile\n\n2. OPTIMIZE USER INFO DISPLAY\n   [ ] Show author info only once per comment thread\n   [ ] Move redundant metadata (title) to optional badge/label\n   [ ] Consider displaying author info above thread instead of in comment\n   [ ] Keep timestamp visible but compact (relative time: '2h ago')\n   [ ] Show author's badge/role efficiently without waste\n\n3. IMPROVE SPACE EFFICIENCY\n   [ ] Reduce vertical spacing between comments (conditional on nesting level)\n   [ ] Use consistent grid-based spacing\n   [ ] Compact reply header design\n   [ ] Optimize avatar + text layout\n   [ ] Better use of horizontal space\n\n4. ENHANCE VISUAL HIERARCHY\n   [ ] Distinct visual treatment for top-level vs nested comments\n   [ ] Color-code nesting levels or use opacity gradients\n   [ ] Clear visual distinction between comment and its replies\n   [ ] Better affordances for reply interaction\n   [ ] Collapsible comment threads (show 'n replies' button)\n\n5. IMPLEMENT DEEPER NESTING\n   [ ] Support unlimited nesting depth (or practical limit like 5-7 levels)\n   [ ] Prevent right-side overflow on very deep threads\n   [ ] Add 'continue reading thread' for very deep nesting\n   [ ] Maintain readability at all nesting levels\n\nTECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n\nFiles to Modify:\n- src/components/discussions/ReplyCard.tsx - Individual comment component\n- src/components/discussions/ReplyList.tsx - Comment list and grouping logic\n- src/app/globals.css - Add CSS for tree visualization and connectors\n\nDesign Patterns to Implement:\n1. CSS Approach: Use left-border with background-image for vertical lines\n2. Pseudo-elements: ::before and ::after for connector lines\n3. Recursive Component Structure: Support infinite nesting\n4. Optional Collapsing: Add collapse/expand functionality\n\nCSS Techniques (based on CSS-Tricks styling):\n- Position absolute left borders with correct height calculation\n- Use border-left for main thread line\n- Use border-left with gradient for color transitions\n- Clickable areas (12px) wider than visible border (4px)\n- Fixed header height for border calculation\n\nComponents to Refactor:\n1. ReplyCard\n   - Separate header display logic\n   - Add visual tree connector elements\n   - Implement collapse state\n   - Optimize metadata layout\n\n2. ReplyList\n   - Recursively build tree structure\n   - Group replies at multiple levels\n   - Add visual styling for tree connections\n   - Implement collapse/expand groups\n\nDESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nColor Scheme for Nesting Levels:\n- Level 0 (top): Primary color (sage/green)\n- Level 1: Secondary color (terracotta/orange)\n- Level 2: Tertiary color (muted sage)\n- Level 3+: Grayscale gradient\n\nSpacing:\n- Top-level comment: Space-y-6 (existing)\n- First-level nested: Space-y-3\n- Deeper nested: Space-y-2\n- No left margin, use visual border instead\n\nTypography:\n- Author name: Keep bold\n- Title/badge: Make optional, subtle styling\n- Timestamp: Keep small and secondary\n- Hide title on very deep nesting if space is tight\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- [ ] Visual tree lines connect parent and child comments\n- [ ] Left-side borders show nesting depth\n- [ ] User info displayed efficiently without redundancy\n- [ ] Supports minimum 3+ levels of nesting (like Reddit)\n- [ ] Collapse/expand functionality for nested threads\n- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile (375px+)\n- [ ] Performance: No lag with 100+ comments\n- [ ] Accessibility: Tree structure clear via semantic HTML\n- [ ] Tested with real comment threads (deep nested conversations)\n\nINSPIRATION SOURCES:\n- Reddit comment threads: https://reddit.com/r/announcements/\n- CSS-Tricks styling guide: https://css-tricks.com/styling-comment-threads/\n- Medium.com nested comments UI\n\nRELATED ISSUES:\n- Part of larger discussion UX improvements\n- Complements existing thread voting and reply functionality\n- Sets stage for advanced comment features (threading, mentions, etc.)","notes":"Research completed on Reddit's design approach and CSS tree visualization techniques.

{"id":"cgrs-frontend-6sp","title":"Month Calendar: Date positioning and event indicator redesign","description":"# Month Calendar - Date Cell Design Improvements\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe month calendar's day cells have two usability issues that reduce visual hierarchy and make event scanning difficult:\n\n1. **Date Number Positioning**: The day number is centered both vertically and horizontally in the cell. This is inconsistent with Google Calendar's design pattern where the date is positioned at the top of the cell, making it easier to scan down a column of dates.\n\n2. **Event Indicators Too Small**: The colored dots representing events are only 6-7px diameter. These are a critical visual element for quickly identifying days with events, but are currently too small to create visual impact.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n**Files involved:**\n- `src/components/calendar/DateCell.tsx` - Day cell component (lines 65-87 contain date number and dots)\n- `src/app/globals.css` - Styling at lines 1816-1920\n\n**Current CSS:**\n- `.date-cell-compact` uses `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center`\n- `.item-dot` is 6px (mobile) / 7px (desktop)\n\n## Requirements (80% - Clear Specifications)\n\n### 1. Date Number Positioning\n- Date number MUST be positioned at the **top-center** of the cell (not centered vertically)\n- This aligns with Google Calendar's month view pattern\n- Maintains readability when scanning down calendar columns\n\n### 2. Event Indicators Enhancement\n- Event indicators MUST be visually prominent (at least 3x larger than current 6-7px)\n- Consider alternatives to dots: small colored bars/blocks (like Google Calendar), or larger circular indicators\n- Indicators MUST remain clearly associated with their date cell\n- Support for multiple event types via different colors (existing functionality)\n\n### 3. Responsive Behavior\n- Changes must work across mobile (375px+), tablet, and desktop viewports\n- Ensure sufficient touch targets for mobile interaction\n\n### 4. Accessibility\n- Maintain existing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation\n- Ensure sufficient color contrast for event indicators\n\n## Solution Space (20% - Agent Creative Freedom)\n\nThe agent has flexibility to determine:\n- Exact pixel sizing for event indicators (recommend 10-14px minimum for visual impact)\n- Shape: dots, rounded rectangles/bars, or other creative solutions\n- Positioning of indicators relative to date number (below, or spanning the cell)\n- Whether to use animation or hover effects for additional prominence\n- Use of the existing color system (terracotta, sage, forest) or expanded palette\n\n## Design References\n\n- Google Calendar month view: Date number at top, event bars/blocks below\n- Modern Material 3 Expressive redesign uses rounded cell corners with color backgrounds\n- Event indicators should be one of the most prominent elements in the calendar\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Date number appears at top-center of cell, not centered\n2. Event indicators are minimum 10px in size (or equivalent visual weight)\n3. Calendar remains usable on mobile (375px width)\n4. All existing calendar functionality preserved (date selection, navigation)\n5.

{"id":"cgrs-frontend-ejj","title":"Discussion Page: Equal height sidebar and content panel + bg-sage-light","description":"# Discussion Page - Equal Height Layout \u0026 Background Color\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nTwo design issues on the discussion landing page:\n\n1. **Unequal Height Between Sidebar and Content Panel**\n   - The category tabs (left sidebar) and discussions-content-panel (right) have mismatched heights\n   - When there are few threads, the content panel is shorter than the category tabs\n   - This creates visual imbalance - the category tabs appear \"taller\" than the content\n   - Both sections should stretch to match the tallest element (standard flexbox equal-height columns pattern)\n\n2. **White Background Creates Visual Clutter**\n   - The `discussions-content-panel` uses `background: white`\n   - The site has many white background elements, causing visual fatigue\n   - Should use `bg-sage-light` for better visual hierarchy and variety\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n### Files Involved\n- `src/app/globals.css` - Lines 5935-6097\n\n### Current CSS\n```css\n/* Layout container (line 5935) */\n.discussions-sidebar-layout {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 0;\n  min-height: 600px;\n}\n\n/* Content panel (line 6087) */\n.discussions-content-panel {\n  flex: 1;\n  background: white;  /* \u003c-- ISSUE: should be sage-light */\n  border: 1px solid rgba(168, 181, 160, 0.2);\n  border-radius: 0 16px 16px 16px;\n  padding: var(--space-lg);\n  min-width: 0;\n  /* ... */\n}\n```\n\n### Missing CSS\n- `.discussions-sidebar-layout` lacks `align-items: stretch` (the default, but should be explicit)\n- `.discussions-content-wrapper` may need adjustment to allow stretching\n\n## Requirements (80% - Clear Specifications)\n\n### 1. Equal Height Layout\n- The category tabs sidebar and content panel MUST be equal height\n- Both elements should stretch to match the tallest element\n- Use CSS flexbox `align-items: stretch` on the parent container\n- If content is shorter than sidebar, content panel still matches sidebar height\n- If content is taller than sidebar, sidebar matches content height\n\n### 2. Background Color Change\n- `discussions-content-panel` MUST use `bg-sage-light` instead of `white`\n- This applies to the rounded panel on the right side\n- Ensure text remains readable against sage-light background\n- Check contrast ratios for accessibility\n\n### 3. Responsive Behavior\n- On mobile (\u003c 1024px), layout stacks vertically - this behavior should remain\n- The equal-height fix applies primarily to desktop layout\n\n### 4. Visual Integrity\n- The border and shadow treatments should work well with sage-light\n- May need subtle border color adjustment for sage-light background\n\n## Solution Space (20% - Agent Creative Freedom)\n\nThe agent can determine:\n- Exact CSS approach for equal-height (align-items: stretch vs other methods)\n- Whether to add `align-items: stretch` explicitly to `.discussions-sidebar-layout` or `.discussions-content-wrapper`\n- Any border/shadow adjustments needed for sage-light background\n- Whether `--sage-light` CSS variable exists or needs to be created\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Category tabs and content panel are always equal height on desktop\n2. Content panel uses `bg-sage-light` (or equivalent variable)\n3. Mobile layout (stacked) continues to work correctly\n4. Text remains readable with new background\n5. Visual design remains polished with shadows/borders\n6.

When MonthCalendar grows (content-heavy months), MonthNavigation gets cut off.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Issues\n\n**1. Shared Container Anti-Pattern (CalendarViewContainer.tsx:41-55)**\n- Single .calendar-grid-column wraps both MonthCalendar and MonthNavigation\n- No layout separation between primary calendar and year navigation\n- overflow: hidden clips year navigation when content overflows\n- FIX: Split into two sibling containers with explicit height allocations\n\n**2. Mobile Viewport Constraint Too Aggressive (globals.css:1701)**\n```css\n.calendar-grid-column {\n  max-height: 40vh; /* Too restrictive for combined content */\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n```\n- 40vh insufficient for both calendar grid + year nav on small viewports\n- overflow: hidden silently clips navigation instead of scrolling\n- FIX: After splitting containers, allocate ~60-70% to calendar, ~30-40% to year nav\n\n**3. No Flex/Grid Layout for Vertical Distribution**\n- Current: linear stacking with no height control\n- MonthNavigation has flex: 1 (CSS line 2824) but parent isn't flexbox\n- FIX: Make .calendar-grid-column a flexbox or split into two containers\n\n---\n\n### Warnings\n\n**1. MonthNavigation useMemo Dependency (MonthNavigation.tsx:101)**\n```tsx\nuseMemo(() =\u003e {\n  // ... month calculation\n}, [items]); // Removed currentMonth dependency (comment line 101)\n```\n- Intentionally anchored to 'Today' (line 88), not currentMonth\n- Prevents navigation from dynamically updating when user changes months\n- CONSIDER: If this is intentional for UX, document WHY in code comment\n\n**2. Unstable Event Handlers (CalendarContent.tsx:91-126)**\n- All handlers wrapped in useCallback ✓\n- Dependencies look correct ✓\n- BUT: handleDateClick depends on itemsByDate Map (line 121)\n  - Maps are referentially unstable even if contents identical\n  - SUGGESTION: Extract date→item lookup logic to avoid depending on entire Map\n\n**3. Client Component Boundary (CalendarViewContainer.tsx:1)**\n- 'use client' directive present\n- Component receives only serializable props ✓\n- All children are also client components\n- CONSIDER: Could MonthNavigation be server component? It only needs items array and currentMonth\n  - Current: all client-side due to onClick handlers\n  - FUTURE: Extract presentation into RSC, wrap buttons in client component\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions\n\n**1. Component Responsibility Separation**\nCurrent: CalendarViewContainer handles both layout AND composition\nBetter: Extract layout logic into CalendarLayoutGrid component\n```tsx\n// CalendarLayoutGrid.tsx (presentation)\nexport function CalendarLayoutGrid({ \n  calendarSection, \n  navigationSection, \n  detailSection \n}) {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"calendar-view-container\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"calendar-left-column\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv className=\"calendar-section\"\u003e{calendarSection}\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv className=\"navigation-section\"\u003e{navigationSection}\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"calendar-detail-column\"\u003e{detailSection}\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**2. CSS Architecture Improvement**\nCurrent naming is unclear (.calendar-grid-column contains non-grid elements)\nSuggested structure:\n```css\n.calendar-left-column {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  gap: var(--space-sm);\n}\n\n.calendar-section {\n  flex: 0 1 65%; /* 65% of vertical space */\n  overflow-y: auto;\n}\n\n.navigation-section {\n  flex: 0 1 35%; /* 35% of vertical space */\n  overflow: visible; /* Never clip year nav */\n}\n```\n\n**3. Accessibility Enhancement**\n- MonthPage buttons have aria-label ✓ (MonthNavigation.tsx:57)\n- BUT: Year overview nav has no aria-live region for screen readers\n- ADD: aria-live=\"polite\" to announce month selection changes\n\n**4. Performance Optimization**\n- MonthNavigation recalculates all 6 months on every items change (line 85-101)\n- getMonthEventColors loops through ALL items for each month (lines 19-30)\n- OPTIMIZATION: Build month→colors Map once, reuse across renders\n```tsx\nconst monthColorsMap = useMemo(() =\u003e {\n  const map = new Map();\n  for (const item of items) {\n    const monthKey = item.date.substring(0, 7); // \"2026-02\"\n    if (!map.has(monthKey)) map.set(monthKey, []);\n    map.get(monthKey).push(getTypeColor(item.type));\n  }\n  return map;\n}, [items]);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Positive Notes\n\n✓ Proper useCallback usage prevents unnecessary re-renders (CalendarContent.tsx:91-126)\n✓ useMemo for expensive derived state (itemsByDate, groupedItems)\n✓ Scroll behavior correctly waits for Framer Motion animations (CalendarContent.tsx:82-84)\n✓ URL params properly initialize state (CalendarContent.tsx:21-37)\n✓ Loading and error states handled gracefully (CalendarContent.tsx:128-138)\n✓ Dynamic import with proper loading fallback (calendar/page.tsx:8-11)\n✓ Suspense boundary for proper streaming (calendar/page.tsx:77)\n✓ Semantic HTML structure with proper refs\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Fix Approach\n\n**Phase 1: Layout Separation (component-builder)**\n1. Update CalendarViewContainer.tsx to use two distinct sections\n2. Add .calendar-section and .navigation-section wrappers\n3. Update globals.css with flex-based height distribution\n\n**Phase 2: CSS Constraints (component-builder)**\n1. Remove aggressive overflow: hidden from shared container\n2. Add overflow-y: auto to calendar section only\n3. Test responsive breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1024px)\n\n**Phase 3: Performance (optional, lower priority)**\n1. Optimize getMonthEventColors with Map-based caching\n2. Extract date lookup logic from handleDateClick dependency\n\n**Phase 4: Testing (test-runner)**\n1. Verify year nav visible at 375px, 600px, 900px, 1440px\n2. Check overflow behavior with content-heavy months\n3. Validate keyboard navigation and screen reader announcements\n","created_at":"2026-02-15T11:02:16Z"},{"id":27,"issue_id":"cgrs-frontend-pqw","author":"Dameon","text":"📋 CODE REVIEW FINDINGS\n\nROOT CAUSE:\n- Single .calendar-grid-column container wraps BOTH MonthCalendar and MonthNavigation\n- Mobile: max-height: 40vh with overflow: hidden (too restrictive)\n- Both components compete for vertical space in same container\n- When MonthCalendar grows, MonthNavigation gets clipped\n\nCRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:\n1.
