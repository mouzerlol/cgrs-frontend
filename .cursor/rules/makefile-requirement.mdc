# Makefile Requirement for Projects

All projects must include a `Makefile` in the root directory with standard commands for common development tasks. This ensures consistent development workflows across all projects.

## Required Makefile Commands

Every project Makefile should include at least these commands:

### Core Commands
- `make help` - Show available commands and their descriptions
- `make install` - Install project dependencies
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make lint` - Run code linting
- `make format` - Format code according to project standards
- `make check` - Run comprehensive quality checks (lint + test)

### Additional Recommended Commands
- `make clean` - Clean up generated files and caches
- `make build` - Build the project/package
- `make run` - Run the main application
- `make dev` - Quick development cycle (format + lint + test)

## Makefile Template

```makefile
.PHONY: help install test lint format check clean

help: ## Show this help message
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  %-15s %s\n", $$1, $$2}'

install: ## Install dependencies
	# Add your installation command here

test: ## Run tests
	# Add your test command here

lint: ## Run linting
	# Add your linting command here

format: ## Format code
	# Add your formatting command here

check: format lint test ## Run all quality checks

clean: ## Clean up generated files
	rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/ .pytest_cache/ .coverage htmlcov/
```

## Usage

After creating a Makefile, developers can use:

```bash
make help          # See all available commands
make install       # Set up the project
make check         # Run quality checks before committing
make clean         # Clean up before packaging
```

## Python Projects

For Python projects using UV package manager, use this pattern:

```makefile
install:
	uv sync

test:
	uv run pytest

lint:
	uv run flake8 .

format:
	uv run black .
	uv run isort .
```

This ensures consistent development workflows and makes projects more accessible to new contributors.
